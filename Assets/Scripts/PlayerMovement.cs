    /*
     * TO DO:
     * Movement
     *      -Should use the CharacterController which is already attached to this GameObject-
     *      -Be able to move left and right-
     *      -Collide with/be stopped by walls-
     *      -Not move too quickly or slowly-
     *          -Remember that movement happens every frame-
     * Jumping/Falling
     *      -Fall to the ground, and not through it-
     *      -Able to jump-
     *      -Can reach platforms to the right, but not the one on the left-
     *      -Only able to jump while standing on the ground-
     * Input
     *      -Ideally, use the KeyboardInput script which is already attached to this GameObject-
     *      -A & D for left and right movement-
     *      -Space for jumping-
     * Moving Platform
     *      -When standing on the platform, the character should stay on it/move relative to the moving platform-
     *      -When not standing on the platform, revert to normal behavior-
     * Enemy
     *      -If the character touches the enemy, he should "die"-
     *      
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Variables you might want:
     *      References to the CharacterController and Keyboard input classes
     *      Speed values for moving, falling, and jumping
     *      A value to keep track of the player's movement speed and direction
     *      You will probably need to use the Update function as well as create functions for moving platforms and enemies
